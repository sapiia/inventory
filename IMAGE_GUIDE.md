## 💡 Tips

- **Image Size**: Images are automatically resized to fit (64x64px in table, 192x192px in details)
- **No Image**: If you don't add an image, a default icon will be shown
- **Broken Links**: If the image URL doesn't work, a placeholder icon appears
- **Preview**: Always check the preview before saving to ensure the image loads correctly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
- Make sure the URL ends with an image extension (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- Check if the URL is publicly accessible (not behind a login)
- Try copying the image address again
- Use one of the sample images to test

**Image too large/small?**
- Don't worry! The system automatically resizes all images
- For best results, use square images (1:1 ratio)

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive images** that match your item name
2. **Test the URL** by pasting it in a new browser tab first
3. **Use reliable sources** like Unsplash or Imgur for stability
4. **Keep URLs short** when possible for easier management
5. **Update images** if links break over time
